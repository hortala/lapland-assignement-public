                            <h3>Winter</h3>
                            <p>The most memorable moments of winter in Lapland are undoubtedly the aurora borealis, which appears almost every clear night from September to March. Sometimes the light from the Northern Lights can even illuminate the snowy
                                landscape and guide skiers to their homes. Winter temperatures can drop to -30 째 C, do not forget to cover yourself when you go hunting for aurora borealis. If you want to live this hot experience, you can stay in one of
                                the many elegant igloo hotels and enjoy the aurora borealis show from the comfort of your bed. Lapland is also home to the one and only Santa Claus, whose workshop is undoubtedly the place that fascinates children the most.
                                At any time of the year, you are welcome to Santa Claus Village, located in Rovaniemi, and you can personally give him and his merry goblins your gift list. Also watch out for Santa's reindeer, especially the red-nosed
                                reindeer! You can not visit Lapland without discovering local animals. Sledding with husks and huskies is the most popular winter sport in Lapland: the speed of reindeer is rather moderate, they are accessible to all. If
                                you want to attend a truly unique show, visit Inari, where the breeders of these animals gather at the big reindeer races that take place each spring. Do not let the Arctic cold get the better of you: as the sauna is also
                                an essential part of Finnish culture, you will always find a place to warm up. Designed to wash physically and spiritually, the Finnish ritual is the best way to savor it. Let yourself be steamed in the sauna before you
                                swim quickly in an icy lake or ride in the snow. This is not a joke, that's what the Finns really do! And it even seems like it's good for your bloodstream.</p>

                            <h3>Spring</h3>
                            <p>In Lapland, spring is the ideal season for skiing. The days are noticeably lighter and longer than in winter, turning the hills into a sun-kissed ski paradise. The four largest Finnish ski resorts are in Lapland: Levi, Yll채s,
                                Pyh채-Luosto and Ruka. They peak at more than 500 and 700 meters above sea level and offer trails up to 3 kilometers long. Ski enthusiasts will find everything they need, from kids' trails to black runs and snow parks to
                                off-road expeditions. Unlike the crowded ski resorts of Central Europe, Lapland allows you to enjoy this experience in a much more relaxed way. For your ski holiday, you have the opportunity to book a few days in a log
                                cabin at one of the Lapland ski resorts. Many village-style resorts offer restaurants, bars, shops, spas and much more, especially Levi, Finland's busiest ski resort. Spring is also the season of holidays, like Easter and
                                May 1st, called Vappu, during which wild parties invade the whole country. Many events are organized at the resorts to celebrate the best time of the year for skiing and snowboarding. The traditional ski race, the northernmost
                                ski marathon in the world, takes place every year in April on an old mail distribution route linking the village of Hetta, Finland, to Kautokeino, Norway. Snowshoeing is another key sport in Lapland. It's a great way to
                                breathe clean, fresh air while testing your endurance. Explore the magic of quiet forests in winter with a hiking guide, and float over the snow meters with your snowshoes. Cross-country skiing is also highly recommended
                                for those who want to train their body and free their minds. With a little luck, you can see some wild animals during your journey, such as squirrels, rabbits, reindeer or birds.</p>

                            <p>During the summer in Lapland, the sun does not set for more than 70 days in a row. You can spend those endless days sailing, swimming, fishing, golfing or participating in cultural events such as the Sodankyl채 Midnight Sun
                                Film Festival or the Jutajaiset Folklore Festival in Rovaniemi. If you want to enjoy the summer like a real Finn, just rent a cottage near a lake and relax. Lapland is nicknamed "the land of dreams". If you watch "The Gold
                                Rush" on the Discovery Channel and still feel the Gold Fever, its mythical golden fields will make your dreams come true. Try your luck at the Gold Village of Tankavaara, the only authentic gold mining village in Europe!</p>

                            <p>Once summer is over, the landscape is adorned with soft, intense leaves. It is advisable to wait until the end of September to observe this spectacular natural phenomenon, which locals call "Ruska". Hiking is the ideal activity
                                to enjoy the richness of nature: the mild temperature of autumn and the various trails of Lapland will delight both beginners and more experienced hikers. Urho Kekkonen National Park, Finland's second largest park, is one
                                of Lapland's most coveted hiking trails. It covers 2,550 square kilometers and offers a wide range of landscapes, ranging from towering hills to wooded areas.</p>

                    <p>This berry growing in peat bogs has many names in Finnish, and in French (Canada) also: blackberry marsh, platebi챔re, cloudberry, peat burr, brambleberry. The Arctic Blackberry is a perennial, 10-25 cm tall, double-leafed, single-flowered
                        plant with a creeping stem that is numb. The leaves are wrinkled and kidney-shaped. The plant is dioecious ie stamens and carpels are on separate plants. The flower is formed of five white petals and the flowering takes place in
                        June. During its growth, the fruit undergoes several changes of color: first, the bay is greenish yellow, then red and finally mature: yellow, juicy, tasty and fragrant. Once ripe, the bay is easily detached from its peduncle.</p>
